# Project Spec: Pangolog

## Overview

A minimalist personal expense tracker progressive web app with a focus on simplicity, cross-device persistence, and data ownership.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: NextJS, Tailwind, IndexedDB, Biome for linting
- State management: Zustand, TanStack Query
- Backend: Google Drive for cloud sync
- Deployment: Vercel

Approach:
    - TanStack Query as the source of truth for UI
    - IndexedDB as the local cache/persistence layer
    - Google Drive as the remote backup

## Business logic terms:
- Big buck: large and irregular transactions attached to a year.
- Small dime: small daily transactions attached to a month.

## Features

### Transaction management
- Read: query small dime transactions by month
- Read: query big buck transactions by month
- Read: search by text description among currently displayed transactions
- Create: create new transactions with the following setting options
    - Transaction amount
    - Expense or income
    - Small dime or big buck
    - One single category to attach the transaction to
- Create: recurring transaction on a weekly or monthly basis
- Update: edit existing transactions
- Delete: permanently remove existing transactions

### Category management
- Read: view current categories
- Create: add new categories
    - Name
    - Colour
    - Emoji icon
- Update: reorder category priority in the create transaction dialog
- Delete: remove transaction

### Advanced financial review:
- View pie chart summary by month, with and without big buck transactions
- View pie chart summary by year, with and without big buck transactions

### Synchronisation
- Cloud synchronisation is entirely optional, users can start using immediately without providing Google Drive authorisation.
- New users are seeded with demo data (categories: Food, Grocery, Videogame; transactions: Eggs, Sandwich, What Remains of Edith Finch).
- On first sync, users are prompted whether to carry over seed data to the cloud or discard it before syncing.
- Data is sync'ed with transaction, debounced to 30s.
- Data is sync'ed upon `visibilitychange` and `document.visibilityState === hidden`.
- Data is resolved on the "Last write wins", using `updatedAt`.
- Transactions are not hard-deleted. Use `deletedAt`.
- Deleted transactions remain stored to facilitate deletion propagation.
- Data with `deletedAt` older than 30 days are removed on both local and cloud instance.

### Error recovery strategies
- Exponential backoff (30s, 60s, 120s, 300s)
- Max retry attempts: 5
- Failed operations stored in sync queue
- Manual retry option in UI

### Data mobility
- Export transactions to JSON, xls or csv
- Import transactions from local JSON, xls or csv
- Data import should be able to also add categories

### Other settings
- Freely user-set custom currency (as a string), as a prefix or suffix. E.g. `$12` or `12k IDR`. This is merely a cosmetic display unit, and has no bearing on the logic and/or data.

### Offline support
- Works offline without an internet connection
- Offline indicator
- Queue changes made offline for sync when connection returns

## Data model

### Table `dimes`
- `id`: uuid, autogenerated primary key.
- `transactedAt`: iso timestamp, datetime of transaction.
- `updatedAt`: iso timestamp, date of updating (also for collision resolution logic).
- `deletedAt`: iso timestamp, date of deletion for soft deletion and sync'ing purpose. `null` by default.
- `categoryId`: uuid, foreign key to `categories`.
- `amount`: integer (Stored as minor units, e.g., 100 for $1.00 or 100 for 100 VND).
    - Must be > 0
- `year`: integer, derived field from `transactedAt`
- `month`: integer, derived field from `transactedAt`
- `description`: string, user description for the transaction.
- `isIncome`: boolean, whether the transaction is a positive income instead of expense.
- indexes:
    - [year, month] for month queries
    - categoryId for joins
    - transactedAt for sorting

### Table `bucks`
- `id`: uuid, autogenerated primary key.
- `transactedAt`: iso timestamp, datetime of transaction.
- `updatedAt`: iso timestamp, date of updating (also for collision resolution logic).
- `deletedAt`: iso timestamp, date of deletion for soft deletion and sync'ing purpose. `null` by default.
- `categoryId`: uuid, foreign key to `categories`.
- `amount`: integer (Stored as minor units, e.g., 100 for $1.00 or 100 for 100 VND).
- `year`: integer, derived field from `transactedAt`
- `description`: string, user description for the transaction.
- `isIncome`: boolean, whether the transaction is a positive income instead of expense.
- indexes:
    - year queries
    - categoryId for joins
    - transactedAt for sorting

### Table `categories`
- `id`: uuid, autogenerated primary key.
- `createdAt`: iso timestamp, datetime of creation.
- `updatedAt`: iso timestamp, date of updating (also for collision resolution logic).
- `colour`: string, colour hex code.
- `icon`: string, the single emoji icon for the category.
- `priority`: number, custom sort order value.
- `isBuckOnly`: boolean, this will only be displayed when adding Big Buck expenses.
- `isIncomeOnly`: boolean, this will only be displayed when adding income transactions.
    A category can be both `isBuckOnly` and `isIncomeOnly` and these are not mutually exclusive.

### Table `recurring-rules`
- `id`: uuid, primary key
- `createdAt`: iso timestamp
- `updatedAt`: iso timestamp
- `deletedAt`: iso timestamp
- `categoryId`: uuid, foreign key to categories
- `amount`: integer (minor units)
- `description`: string
- `isIncome`: boolean
- `isBigBuck`: boolean
- `frequency`: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'yearly'
- `interval`: integer (e.g., 2 for every 2 weeks)
- `dayOfWeek`: integer (0-6, for weekly)
- `dayOfMonth`: integer (1-31, for monthly)
- `monthOfYear`: integer (1-12, for yearly)
- `lastGeneratedAt`: iso timestamp
- `nextGenerationAt`: iso timestamp
- `isActive`: boolean

## LocalStorage global state data
- `isDarkTheme`: boolean
- `isSyncEnabled`: boolean
- `lastSyncTime`: iso string
- `syncError`: string
- ~~`hasUsedBefore`: boolean,~~ no longer used
- `isViewingBigBucks`: boolean
- `shouldIncludeBucksInDimes`: boolean
- `lastSelectedMonth`: string, e.g. `"2026-02"`

## LocalStorage settings to be synced
- `customCurrency`: string, custom currency set by user, empty by default.
- `isPrefixCurrency`: boolean, whether to display the currency in front of the amount, to differentiate different conventions. E.g. $12 and 12 SGD.

## Storage approach
- OAuth scope: `drive.file` + `drive.readonly` — `drive.readonly` enables cross-device file discovery (listing all files in the Pangolog folder); `drive.file` handles creating and updating files. Files remain visible in the user's Google Drive.
- Files are stored in a dedicated `Pangolog` folder in the user's Drive root.
- Settings are stored in `settings.json`.
- Categories are stored in `categories.json`.
- Small dime transactions are stored on a monthly basis, e.g. `2026-02.json`.
- Big bucks are stored separately on a yearly basis, e.g. `2026-bucks.json`.

## Design system
- User-switchable dark/light theme
- UI library: HeroUI
- Vibe: minimalist, clear, and readable. Heavy usage of monospace fonts.
- Loading states for async operations.
- Skeleton screens for initial loads.
- Toast notifications for sync status and errors.

### Layout
(Excluding Landing Page)
- Main view
- Navbar to switch between routes
- Floating CTA button `Add transaction` (or `Add category` in the category route)
- Sync status indicator
    - Grey: not configured
    - Green: synced
    - Blue: sync in progress
    - Red: encountering error, with message

### Views

- Transaction view:
    - List of transactions according to current settings in descending order (lower is older)
    - Toggle switch: Small Dimes vs Big Bucks
    - Checkbox: (Small Dimes only) Also show Big Buck transactions
    - Calendar month picker: (Small Dimes only) Month to display Small Dimes transactions
    - Accordion: Toggle filter transactions by categories
    - Empty state: there is no transaction for this month/year
    - Item without category is marked `uncategorised`

- Magic input in transaction view, ignore this unless specified:
    - A magic input with multiple function
    - Primary function: search by description
    - Alternative function: add new transaction via specified syntax
        - `t: <amount> <category priority index> <-b> <-i>`
            - Flag: `-b` for big buck
            - Flag: `-i` for income
        - e.g. `t: 12 2` adds a new Small Dime expense transaction of $12, with the category with priority index 2.
        - e.g. `t: 500 -i -b` adds a new Big Buck income transaction of $500, with no category.
    - Quick focus with Ctrl/Cmd + F

- Dialog: add new transaction/edit transaction (shared by both Small Dimes and Big Bucks)
    - Toggle switch: income vs expense.
    - Toggle switch: Small Dimes vs Big Bucks (not available when editing).
    - Date of transaction: current date by default
    - Category accordion:
        - Collapsed: 7 categories of highest priority.
        - Expended: show all categories in a half-screen scrollable area.
        - Selecting a Category is performed by clicking on a Category that is not yet selected.
        - Deselecting a Category is performed by clicking on the selected Category.
    - Input is capped to two decimal points.
    - Future consideration: setting for auto-adding decimal point.

- Summary view
    - Toggle switch: monthly vs yearly.
    - Checkbox: should include Big Buck transactions
    - Data: Pie chart of expenses and incomes with legends

- Landing page
    - Overview description of the app.
    - Default page if user is just a visitor.
    - Approach for implementation:
        - Check existing IndexedDB data.
        - ~~Set flag on first meaningful action (e.g. adding first transaction or category?) `hasUsedBefore` (invisible to user).~~ User will now have free access to all routes without any intentional redirection. PWA manifest will point to the main route as the default starting url.
        - Implement a root page and return accordingly.

- Category management view
    - Drag and drop list of categories
    - Item comes with edit button
    - Priority index (array index + 1) should be clearly visible
    - Empty state: There is no category created yet

- Dialog: add/edit category
    - Name
    - Colour hex code (colour picker included)
    - Emoji-based icon
    - Checkbox: is income-only category
    - Checkbox: is big buck-only category

- Settings view
    - Custom display currency unit
    - Configuring Drive sync

## Technical Decisions

### Separation of Big Bucks and Small Dimes storage (vs `isBigBuck`)
- Query patterns are separated
- Storage strategy matches query patterns
- Indexes are simpler and more efficient
- Reduce metadata requires for Google Drive files
